# nodechain
A Simple Node.js Blockchain just for fun!

# Why a Blockchain?
After needing to understand blockchain for a project at my internship, I decided that the best way to learn blockchain would be to make a bockchain!

# Features to Implement
* RESTful API to interact with the Blockchain
* More methods to the Blockchain
* P2P connections for Blockchain validation
